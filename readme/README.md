# Bellybutton Biodiversity Dashboard
This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset provides insights into the microbial species that colonize human navels.

Dataset Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset showcases the presence of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing different microbial species found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a few microbial species are prevalent in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining species are relatively rare.

Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Create a dropdown menu to select a test subject ID.
Display demographic information of the selected test subject.
Generate a horizontal bar chart to visualize the top 10 OTUs present in the selected individual.
Build a bubble chart to showcase the distribution and abundance of OTUs across the selected individual.
Develop a gauge chart to represent the belly button washing frequency of the selected individual.
